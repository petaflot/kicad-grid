# kicad-grid

Tool to make arbitrary sized grids of a partial Kicad schematic in a dedicated sub-sheet.

Originaly started to generate a *Charlieplex* input grid (left at this for the moment)


# Thanks

* The entire open-source community, in particular:
    * Python people
    * Kicad people
    * ZMK firmware people
* Bill gates and whoever else was with him at the time (because they wrote MS-DOS and this is what I started with, even though I now avoid M$ products like the pest)
* By extension (last but not least) all those who made micro-controllers possible and available

# Note

yo script kiddies, this is a good one to practice on (see TODOs) ;-)
